song lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Vethra sol karnen thal
Mira dhoon en vel
Korvai lun tressa mor
Shen’ya kev no dal

[Chorus]
THAL-VEN KOR! MIRA DHOON EN THAL!
VES SOL KARN—NO SKY, NO FALL!

[Verse 2]
Dhal’mir ul qen rov
Tressa kor ven sol
Shen’ya mira kevven bor
Lun dhoon en thal vor

[Chorus]
THAL-VEN KOR! MIRA DHOON EN THAL!
VES SOL KARN—NO SKY, NO FALL!

[Bridge]
(whispered)
...shen’ya mira...
(shouted)
SHEN’YA MIRA—THE STONES REMEMBER!

[Chorus]
THAL-VEN KOR! MIRA DHOON EN THAL!
VES SOL KARN—NO SKY, NO FALL!

translation:

[Verse 1]
I trace the cracks where daylight bends
Your name dissolves in falling stones
The path forgets the feet it knew
And roots grow upward through the bone

[Chorus]
RISE THROUGH THE BREAKING GROUND!
NO SKY TO HOLD YOU DOWN!

[Verse 2]
The river climbs the mountain’s spine
Your shadow hardens into dust
We speak in tongues the wind erased
But echo answers back in trust

[Chorus]
RISE THROUGH THE BREAKING GROUND!
NO SKY TO HOLD YOU DOWN!

[Bridge]
(whispered)
...your voice in every pebble...
(shouted)
YOUR VOICE—THE STONES REMEMBER!

[Chorus]
RISE THROUGH THE BREAKING GROUND!
NO SKY TO HOLD YOU DOWN!
